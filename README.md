# Peer-graded Assignment: Getting and Cleaning Data (Course Project)

This project's main aim is to illustrate data collection, cleaning, and manipulation skills. 

The used dataset: https://archive.ics.uci.edu/dataset/240/human+activity+recognition+using+smartphones

Files added to the project

  1. CodeBook.md ----- a codebook that describes the variables, the data, and any transformations or work that I performed to clean up the data
  2. run_analysis.R ----- performs the data preparation and then followed by the 5 steps required as described in the course projectâ€™s definition:
      - Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.
      - Extracts only the measurements on each measurement's mean and standard deviation.
      - Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
      - Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names.
      - From the data set in step 4, create a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.
  3. FinalData.txt ----- is the exported final data after going through all the sequences described above.
